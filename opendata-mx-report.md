# Report from Mexican OpenData Event

I've been invited to attend and discuss open data policies within the OGP with the Mexican Government.
It was a whole day event, on the morning we got and general overview on how the different countries were dealing with the issues of Open Data.

Most of what was said was actually already known to me. But I got particuarly happy with the point of views of Canada and Chile which seems to be
understanding a bit better that open data is not about flashy trendy applications but about changes in the culture of how to do politics and policies.

The Mexican Government seems exited and eager to join the rest of us. They still need to do something and get beyond words only. The plan seem solid if a little
bit focused on 'stars' a side-effect of watching one to many ted talks on opengovt.

The Brazillian presentation was nice. No big surprises and I still think that while our policies and pratices toward open data has indeed advanced a lot there's
still much to be done and the overall culture still don't quite get what openess is all about and the public servants usually position themselves as if we were undermining
the system whenever you ask for transparency in a deeper non-data-driver level.

In the afternoon we did a brainstorming session. David Eaves lead us toward crafting a few ideas that might spread into something interesting. I actually doubt anything will
come out of that - be it because the OGP is not as open and participative as it was supposed to be or just because most of the people in that room met for the first time
and there is still not enought energy to active such processes.

Still, two main ideas came out:
* OpenData4Kids -> Thinking on how can we foster the open data culture and teach kids how to properly understand and care about data. Including that into the k12 curriculum and/or experimenting directly with teachers in a 'Science Fair' like contest.
* OGP Action Plan Exchange Program -> Creating pilot program where the countries presented (plus Colombia and Uruguay) would do an exchange program between them. Electing specific goals from their action plans to be done collaboratively with another country. So, for instance, one could exchange with Brazil to implement the Data portal using CKAN. And in return Brazil could exchange the creation of a public consultancy system with Chile. And so on. By creating this as a metodology we hope we can improve the overall level of sharing knowledge and best pratices among the countries who are - so far - looking solelly for their own belly.

In a non-open-data related note, the food is indeed awesome and the mexican people are really nice. Really hope we can actually pull stuff together :)

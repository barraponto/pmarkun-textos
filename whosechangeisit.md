# Whose change is it anyway?

A Knowledge Exploration program from [Hivos](http://www.hivos.org)

**From Remko**
Generating knowledge for the sake of knowledge.

**From Nishant**
Wants to build a knowledge network within the countries that Hivos acts on.

**Transparency**

Transparency (and data) is not enought. We need not only to see through government, politics, policies... we need to be able to change it. It needs to be pervasive and the limits of 'us' and 'then' need to be radically changed.

We need to hack it.
We need (as a society - not as individuals who have right to privacy) to become radically transparent, we need to build transparency.

- This is project of the Hacker Bus to take aerial pictures with a cheap helium baloon. The idea is to give this tools to communities in the forest to monitor deforestation and to citizens organizations to monitor on the world cup construction sites.

**Hacker**

Hacking is understanding something so deeply that you're able to change it. A computer hacker can understand and make the computer do whatever he wishes - even against it's own original design - we need to be political hackers. Hacking is also an ethical system built upon openess, colaboration and freedom above all.

- This is our Hacker Bus.

**Code**

To properly act on the 'information society' we must be able to read and write bytes. The same way we do think that people should learn how to read and write (text) to be a 'full featured' citizen. Nowdays we should be able to read and write code as well.

- This a piece of my own code. I wrote this in a hackathon last week. And what it does is it presents the projects from the congress that were not approved by the governor of Sao Paulo and asks wheter you agree with it or not. It was done because the Governor didn't aprove 90% of the law projects proposed by the house of representatives.

The crazy part is, after doing the app, I realize that I agree with the governator in about 49% of the time.

**Crochet**

Writing code is not enought. (Digital) technology is not enought. Every technology is (or can be) powerful.

Digital is not awesome because it's digital. It's awesome because it allows sharing.

And sharing is awesome.

So we (at the hacker bus) started learning, teaching and sharing about all sort of things. Whenever we can, we try to make things ourselves instead of buying or hiring people to do it for us. We want to understang things so we can change then.

Now we can do software. Now we can do crochet. Now we can do politics.

- This is a Hacker Bus workshop on Crochet. We began those workshops because we need to make covers for the benches and wanted to do it ourselves. Now we do those workshops all over, because it's really fun. And powerful.

**Future**

This is my daughter.
She is growing up on this really weird unequal world. With all those social injustices and struggles.

But she's also growing up on this really connected world where information is abundant. Where we can connect and talk and share with the whole world.

And this is fucking awesome.

So as a question... what are the knowledges, ethics and techniques that we must - I must - share with my kid for her to be a better citizen and a better person than I am?

## Story Keypoints

* By using and promoting 'open data' and 'transparency' we realized that this was not enought. Knowing the 'what' was not enought, we need to know the 'how' and 'why'.
* Why are things the way they are?
The process is flawed. Both at a cultural level but also at a legal/bureaucratic level.
* How are laws made? Changed? And applied?
	* THacker added a few paragraphs to the FOI law.
	* By giving ideas to a congressman (who later turned out evil) - still indirect and by product of 'friendly politics'.
* Law-making workshop
	* Built for the 'Popular Initiative Laws'
	* Built for better understading the law-making process
	* But specially built so that people can realize that they can also do it.
* Public Consultancy have been used in the making of some laws.
	* FOI
	* Copyright
		* We can't radically change it - because it's in the 'in the stone' section of the Constitution
	* Personal Data
	* Civil Regulation of the internet
* The flaws of FOI law
	* There is a bug in the law that does not obligate the use of Open Data in passive transparency (when answering requests)
	* There is a bug in the law in not explicitly stating that e-mail is to be accepted.
	* There is actually a regulamentation that goes against the law and that is fine!?
	*	There is a cultural challenge

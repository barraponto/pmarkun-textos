## 111 Presentation

**Transparency**

Transparency (and data) is not enought. We need not only to see through government, politics, policies... we need to be able to change it. It needs to be pervasive and the limits of 'us' and 'then' need to be radically changed.

We need to hack it.
We need (as a society - not as individuals who have right to privacy) to become radically transparent, we need to build transparency.

- This is project of the Hacker Bus to take aerial pictures with a cheap helium baloon. The idea is to give this tools to communities in the forest to monitor deforestation and to citizens organizations to monitor on the world cup construction sites.

**Hacker**

Hacking is understanding something so deeply that you're able to change it. A computer hacker can understand and make the computer do whatever he wishes - even against it's own original design - we need to be political hackers. Hacking is also an ethical system built upon openess, colaboration and freedom above all.

- This is our Hacker Bus.

**Code**

To properly act on the 'information society' we must be able to read and write bytes. The same way we do think that people should learn how to read and write (text) to be a 'full featured' citizen. Nowdays we should be able to read and write code as well.

- This a piece of my own code. I wrote this in a hackathon last week. And what it does is it presents the projects from the congress that were not approved by the governor of Sao Paulo and asks wheter you agree with it or not. It was done because the Governor didn't aprove 90% of the law projects proposed by the house of representatives.

The crazy part is, after doing the app, I realize that I agree with the governator in about 49% of the time.

**Crochet**

Writing code is not enought. (Digital) technology is not enought. Every technology is (or can be) powerful.

Digital is not awesome because it's digital. It's awesome because it allows sharing.

And sharing is awesome.

So we (at the hacker bus) started learning, teaching and sharing about all sort of things. Whenever we can, we try to make things ourselves instead of buying or hiring people to do it for us. We want to understang things so we can change then.

Now we can do software. Now we can do crochet. Now we can do politics.

- This is a Hacker Bus workshop on Crochet. We began those workshops because we need to make covers for the benches and wanted to do it ourselves. Now we do those workshops all over, because it's really fun. And powerful.

**Future**

This is my daughter.
She is growing up on this really weird unequal world. With all those social injustices and struggles.

But she's also growing up on this really connected world where information is abundant. Where we can connect and talk and share with the whole world.

And this is fucking awesome.

So as a question... what are the knowledges, ethics and techniques that we must - I must - share with my kid for her to be a better citizen and a better person than I am?

## Story Keypoints

* By using and promoting 'open data' and 'transparency' we realized that this was not enought. Knowing the 'what' was not enought, we need to know the 'how' and 'why'.
* Why are things the way they are?
The process is flawed. Both at a cultural level but also at a legal/bureaucratic level.
* How are laws made? Changed? And applied?
	* THacker added a few paragraphs to the FOI law.
	* By giving ideas to a congressman (who later turned out evil) - still indirect and by product of 'friendly politics'.
* Law-making workshop
	* Built for the 'Popular Initiative Laws'
	* Built for better understading the law-making process
	* But specially built so that people can realize that they can also do it.
* Public Consultancy have been used in the making of some laws.
	* FOI
	* Copyright
		* We can't radically change it - because it's in the 'in the stone' section of the Constitution
	* Personal Data
	* Civil Regulation of the internet
* The flaws of FOI law
	* There is a bug in the law that does not obligate the use of Open Data in passive transparency (when answering requests)
	* There is a bug in the law in not explicitly stating that e-mail is to be accepted.
	* There is actually a regulamentation that goes against the law and that is fine!?
	*	There is a cultural challenge

## Interview - Marco Berlinger

A story about the Anti-globalization (~2000 Italy) and the #Indignados movement (~2011 Spain).

The organizational logic of those movements.
Why the most recents social movements are incable to last?

Anti-globalization
Had a really strong movement but...

Indignados


Is there a possibility to understand more because the decade that separates the two? They both refeer to a change that takes place.

Decline of traditional colective organizations; Political Parties, Trade Unions, NGOs.

---

In the Anti-globalization they were still there and important. Even if the 'protagonists' were from outside those areas- they still played a big role.

The organizational logic in it was actually new. The technologies appeared as key tool - for communication, organization and the shaping of a new public sphere outside the main stream media.

In the new movements  - like Indignados - you don't see any form of 'colective organization'. The participation was of individuals. The social networks the main tool that allowed to aggregate and fire the mobilization.

Another thing to look into the difficult of sustaining the mobilization (in both areas) is the diversity. The anti-globalization movement started a retorical praise for the diversity as an new way to fight at the global level. But that also what lead to the difficulty to stabilish common agendas.

In Indignados, in the squares, it was like a Babel. It was impossible to create those commons agendas - it has to do with the increase of individualization and the decline of the collective organization. Fragmentation of the individualization, of the people.

Do we have/Can we imagine or draw for those experiences (or other) some new organization fixes for those collective dynamics?

**Fighting Political Rights**
* Democracy is not working
* We need to create new ways
* Rights threatened by neo-liberal policies
* New rights

**Do you think they failed?**
You can say they failed. Why they failed at the end? Why they failed in being an lasting actor? To push strategically into changes?

Five stars movement - a movement that won the last election. There is a crise of the political family ideology.

So they failed, but also produced changes in terms of culture. 

**The end?**
It did ended 'literally'. It ended as a mobilization. Ended as public discourse that was able to shape the public agenda.
The fact is that you disappear. It does disappear as a 'spectacle'. (Altought we cannot translate the original idea of spectacle in the new dynamics of networks.)

After the 'end' they start as they start to become invisible, they also start to become more descentralized and start to affect politics and policies more directly.

**Common ground**

Being against something is a platform.
But also, positevelly, there is a systemic critique - that there is a problem with the system itself.
Claim of autonomy. It's very difficult to impose hierarquical organization on those movements.

And against you can see a growth in this culture between the Anti-globalization and Indignados movements.

While in Anti-globalization there was still a perceivable tension between the old organizational ways and the new ways being applied and tried.

In the Indignados that wasn't even a question. If you're a 'digital native' you recognize that you're always in a space with people different than you, in a space without clear hiearquization.

**Autonomy <-> Individualization**

They are similar. But autonomy can also be collective. 
There is a 'respect' of the autonomy. You have to respect the autonomy and the diversity.

Are there other organizational logics to look at this condiction that can transform it into something productive?

Indignados without any resource, program, political experince they've succeded in mobilizing thousands of people, changing the frame from which society recognizes itself.

You've changed hugely! In a really small timeframe.
